/**
 * Trait that classes should implement to read in graphs.
 *
 * The reader class is only required to implement iteratorSeq, a method
 * which returns a sequence of functions that themselves return an Iterator
 * over NodeIdEdgesMaxId (see its type signature below as well).
 *
 * NodeIdEdgesMaxId is a case class defined in ArrayBasedDirectedGraph
 * that stores 1) the id of a node, 2) the ids of its neighbors,
 * and 3) the maximum id of itself and its neighbors.
 *
 * One useful reference implementation is AdjacencyListGraphReader.
