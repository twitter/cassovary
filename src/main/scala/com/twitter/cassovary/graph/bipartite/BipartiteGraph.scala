/**
 * NOTE: this data structure could be memory intensive if the max node ID is much larger
 * than the number of elements in the graph, consider using alternative storage.
 * This class represents an array-based bipartite graph. All its nodes are BipartiteNodes.
 * It maintains two types of ID systems: left node ids (< 0) and right node ids (> 0), id value of 0
 * is not allowed in a Bipartite Graph.
 * Internally it stores two separate arrays, one for left nodes and one for right nodes.
 * The length of the array is the maxNodeId + 1.
 * When a node is being queries, based on the ID value, it converts the ID value to index
 * in the array * (in case of Right, identical; in case of left, the index is id * -1),
 * and retrieves the node object.
 * Edges in the graph fall into two types: from left to right, or from right to left.
 * For example, an edge E that goes from LeftNode A to RightNode B
 * could indicate membership relation.
 * From A's perspective, this is an out-going edge to B, which means A includes B as a member;
 * and similarly from B's perspective, this is an in-coming edge from A, meaning B is included
 * as a member in A.  * Another edge E' that goes from B to A, for example, could carry completely
 * different meaning, e.g. followship.
 * From B's perspective, E' is an out-going edge to A, and means that B follows A, and vice
 * versa from A's perspective. E' is an incoming edge, meaning A is followed by B.
 * If a BipartiteGraph is of direction BipartiteLeftToRight or BipartiteRightToLeft, it carries one
 * semantic meaning between the left and right sides; but if the graph is of direction
 * BipartiteBoth, then it could carry two semantic
 * meanings in one graph (e.g. list-to-user membership and user-to-list followship).
