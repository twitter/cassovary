/**
 * Trait that classes should implement to read in graphs that nodes have
 * ids of type `T`.
 *
 * The reader class is required to implement `iteratorSeq`, a method
 * which returns a sequence of functions that themselves return an `Iterator`
 * over `NodeIdEdgesMaxId` (see its type signature below as well).
 *
 * It is also required to provide a `nodeNumberer[T]`.
 *
 * `NodeIdEdgesMaxId` is a case class defined in `ArrayBasedDirectedGraph`
 * that stores 1) the id of a node, 2) the ids of its neighbors,
 * and 3) the maximum id of itself and its neighbors.
 *
 * One useful reference implementation is `AdjacencyListGraphReader`.
