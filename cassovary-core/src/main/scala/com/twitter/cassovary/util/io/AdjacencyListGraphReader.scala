/**
 * Reads in a multi-line adjacency list from multiple files in a directory, where ids are of type T.
 * Does not check for duplicate edges or nodes.
 *
 * You can optionally specify which files in a directory to read. For example, you may have files starting with
 * "part-" that you'd like to read. Only these will be read in if you specify that as the file prefix.
 *
 * In each file, a node and its neighbors is defined by the first line being that
 * node's id and its # of neighbors, followed by that number of ids on subsequent lines.
 * For example, when ids are Ints,
 *    241 3
 *    2
 *    4
 *    1
 *    53 1
 *    241
 *    ...
 * In this file, node 241 has 3 neighbors, namely 2, 4 and 1. Node 53 has 1 neighbor, 241.
 *
 * Similarly, when ids are String, input file should follow the example:
 *    Alice 2
 *    Bob
 *    Chris
 *    Bob 1
 *    Chris
 *    Chris 1
 *    Bob
 *    ...
 * In this file Alice has 2 directed edges to Bob and Chris, Bob has an edge to Chris,
 * and Chris has outgoing edge to Bob.
 * *
 * @param directory the directory to read from
 * @param prefixFileNames the string that each part file starts with
 * @param nodeNumberer nodeNumberer to use with node ids
 * @param idReader function that can read id from String
