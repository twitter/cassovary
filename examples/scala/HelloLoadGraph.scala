/**
 * A very simple example that loads in a graph from a file and generates stats
 *
 * Specifically, it loads an ArrayBasedDirectedGraph in using AdjacencyListGraphReader,
 * and configures the reader to use 2 threads to load the graph instead of just one.
 * This example loads in both toy_6nodes_adj_1.txt and toy_6nodes_adj_2.txt from
 * src/test/resources/graphs/
